# physics-projects

This is a collection of physics related projects I've made.

### pendulumWithDrag:
- This program is inspired by and partly taken from [3blue1brown's youtube video](https://youtu.be/p_di4Zn4wz4)
- It aims to represent a pendulum with drag through differential equations. Imagine a pendulum at an initial
velocity theta_dot and angle theta. The pendulum will tend towards a state of rest hanging at the bottom.
It may loop around a couple of times before losing enough velocity, however, it will always start to
come to a rest. 
- The relationship between theta and theta_dot can be represented with two axes of a graph
and the result of a given set of inital conditions can be represented as a line.

### projectile:
- This program was inspired by the classic physics 1 problem of a projectile. 
- This assumes no air resistance.
- Using equally long x and y axes, the program shows the arc that a projectile would
take from a given height, angle, and velocity.
